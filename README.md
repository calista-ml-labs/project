## Most Valuable Projects (MVP)

These are the top projects that best represent my skills and focus areas in machine learning and data analysis.

## Projects

### [Project A: Machine Learning Portfolio](https://github.com/calista-ml-labs)

A collection of machine learning projects showcasing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Notes

While many of these projects were initially built through structured learning resources (courses, tutorials, or guided materials), they have been:

* Refactored with clearer data pipelines and reproducible workflows
* Enhanced with additional experiments, metrics, or model comparisons
* Documented to explain problem framing, assumptions, and results

I believe that learning machine learning happens best through **building, testing, and iterating**. These projects serve as both a personal learning archive and a practical demonstration of my growing understanding of machine learning concepts.
