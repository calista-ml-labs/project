## Most Valuable Projects (MVP) 🌟

These are the top projects that best represent my skills and focus areas in machine learning.

* [*Machine Learning Journey*](https://github.com/calistasalsabila/Machine-Learning) ⭐
A structured repository documenting learning progress and experimentation across machine learning concepts and approaches

* [*Indonesian Hoax Detection*](https://github.com/calistasalsabila/indonesian-hoax-detection)
Detecting Indonesian political hoaxes using deep learning and machine learning models through a collaborative study employing Random Forest, LSTM, and BiLSTM architectures.

### Notes

While many of these projects were initially built through structured learning resources (courses, tutorials, or guided materials), they have been:

* Refactored with clearer data pipelines and reproducible workflows
* Enhanced with additional experiments, metrics, or model comparisons
* Documented to explain problem framing, assumptions, and results

I believe that learning machine learning happens best through **building, testing, and iterating**. These projects serve as both a personal learning archive and a practical demonstration of my growing understanding of machine learning concepts.
